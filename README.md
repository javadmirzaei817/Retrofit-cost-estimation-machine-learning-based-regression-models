Retrofit cost estimation machine learning-based regression models
Several retrofitting methods are available for decision-makers, including 
Steel belts, Shotcrete, and FRP. We used a dataset of 168 retrofitting projects
to estimate the cost of retrofitting via various related variables. We used
four machine learning-based regression for modeling, namely Ridge, Lasso, 
Elastic net, and linear regression. We have attached our code for the elastic
net regression on the shotcrete retrofit method in this python file. Don't 
hesitate to get in touch with us for more info.
